# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-29)

**Core value:** Common simulator tasks (env toggles, cert trust, traffic inspection) complete in ≤2 clicks from the side panel.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Network Tools

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Capture Tools
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-30 — Phase 5 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

Progress: [██████████] 4 of 4 Phase-5 plans complete — phase 5 ready for /gsd-verify-work

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4 (GSD-tracked; Phases 1/6 and the Phase 5 core predate .planning)
- Average duration: 18min
- Total execution time: 72min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 5 | 4 | - | - |
**Per-Plan Metrics:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 05 P01 | 37min | 3 tasks | 17 files |
| Phase 05 P02 | 15min | 3 tasks | 11 files |
| Phase 05 P03 | 11min | 2 tasks | 5 files |
| Phase 05 P04 | 9min | 3 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [ingest]: Pulse/PulseProxy exception to the Apple-only dependency policy (user-resolved 2026-08-29)
- [ingest]: Health Data Generator superseded — removed from repo, no roadmap scope; knowledge in intel/context.md only
- [Phase 5]: Command channel bound to loopback 127.0.0.1 with Bonjour ("_booster-cmd._tcp.") — T-05-01 mitigation; fallback to default interface documented if smoke fails discovery
- [Phase 5]: Framework sources behind #if DEBUG && targetEnvironment(simulator) (macOS app target compiles the same folder — prevents duplicate schema symbols); pbxproj uses synchronized groups so new files need no project edits
- [Phase 5]: Framing decode must copy Data to re-based [UInt8] before offset math (Data-slice startIndex trap, SIGTRAP) — fixed in CommandFrame + framework mirror
- [Phase 5]: Throttle pacing contract = chunkInterval chunkBytes*8/kbps s, completion latencyMs + totalBytes*8/kbps (plan truths #1–2; the Task-1 bullet's "1.6s" tail was an internal arithmetic slip) — rescale note for plan-04 smoke in 05-02 SUMMARY
- [Phase 5]: Pacing constructor rejects invalid specs by returning nil (never traps on wire data); framework degrades to unpaced delivery; enforcement chunkBytes = 1500
- [Phase 5]: 05-01's ea7b024 accidentally deleted BoosterCommandClient's private frame constants — framework target had not compiled since; restored in 3a1bb34 (always build the BoosterSimConnect scheme, the macOS app compiles that folder empty)
- [Phase 5]: BlockRule.matches owns the isEnabled check + field trimming (safe for UI and decode paths); every semantic change mirrors identically into NetworkConditionController's framework copy (schema-sync pair, cross-referenced)
- [Phase 5]: 05-04: docs state the AS-SHIPPED pacing contract truthfully (chunkInterval = chunkBytes*8/kbps s, no ÷1000 kilo factor — 3G paces 16 s per 1500 B chunk, 15 KB ≈ 160 s); documented as a known fidelity gap, smoke judges visibility not physical 3G timing
- [Phase 5]: 05-04 phase-gate automated standard: unit bundle via -only-testing:BoosterSimAppTests -skip-testing:BoosterSimAppUITests (exit 0, 44/44) + both scheme builds + Package.resolved sha256 70386616a707… clean across phase (REQ-nfr-03 closed); unfiltered test exits 65 on pristine HEAD (pre-existing UI-test env issue, documented)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: StatusBarSectionView, BuildStatsSectionView/BuildChartView, AXTreeView, CameraView are complete but not wired into the side panel tabs (per codebase-summary) — pick a wiring point during Phase 5 completion or Phase 3 planning.
- [Phase 5]: TrafficDetailView shows placeholder timing metrics (real PulseMetrics is a v2 candidate, NET-02).
- ~~[Phase 5]: 05-01 Task 3 blocking-human Simulator smoke~~ RESOLVED 2026-08-29 — user approved all 7 steps; loopback bind held (A3 valid, fallback unused). Details: 05-01-command-channel-tracer-SUMMARY.md §Checkpoint Resolution.
- ~~[Phase 5]: 05-04 Task 3 blocking-human phase-gate smoke~~ RESOLVED 2026-08-30 — user approved all six groups (AIRPLANE, THROTTLE, BLOCK, RECONCILE, CERTS, CLEAN STATE). Details: 05-04-phase-gate-closure-SUMMARY.md §Checkpoint Resolution.
- [Phase 5][pre-existing]: xcodebuild test exits 65 via post-test app relaunch "Early unexpected exit" flake — reproduced on pristine HEAD; unit suites themselves green (19/19). See deferred-items.md.

## Deferred Items

| Enhancement | Pulse Code 8, real PulseMetrics, includePeerToPeer, e2e Connect test | v2 candidates (NET-01…04) | 2026-08-29 | v1 (ingest) |
